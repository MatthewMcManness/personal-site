            About me
        </h1>

        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Kansas (KU) with a Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education in 2014. Right after I graduated I spent the first "chunk"
            of my adult life as a elementary/middle school teacher. I specialized in teaching social studies.  While teaching I earned
            a Master's Degree in Education from Baker University.   
            While I taught I persued a variety of personal interests, including but not limited to: Website Creation, Woodworking, Homesteading, 
            Animal Rescue, and Indie Game Development. I taught up until 2020 when I decided to persue a career in technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            At that time I re-enrolled at KU persuing a degree in Computer Science.  While there I decided to also earn a Cyber Security Certificate. While
            working toward my degree I also got married to Mariel Dryton.  Shortly before I graduated my son (Gabriel McManness) was born. After earning my CS Degree,
            I stared working at Computer Store Kansas.  I also created my own LLC at this time (Resilient Web Solutions).   
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a person that loves to learn new things and am constantly working on mulitple projects at once (much to my wife's chagrin).  As such,
            I decided to create a place for me document any new projects I work on (this webpage).

    <!-- Why Section -->
    <section id="why" class="section section--dark">
      <div class="section-content">
        <h1>
            Why?
        </h1>
        <p>
            I have found over the years that I desire to have somewhere to look back and help me reflect
            on what I have completed.  Historically, I also haven't had a place to actively process my thoughts
            and refelctions (regarding my projects).  This website gives me a reason to actively process my
            thoughts, and sythesize new ideas for future projects.  It also gives me a place to neatly display
            my work for anyone who is interested in learning about me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have never been a fan of social media and only created a Facebook account when 
            my Elementary Education classmates insisted I create one (during my first time at KU).
            While this page may resemble a form of social media, it does not share the same purpose or
            inherent responsibilities.  It is honestly a place for me, with the upside of it being a 
            place that I can point to, to share information with others quickly and easily if needed.
